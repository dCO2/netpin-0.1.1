## _Hello there!_

Netpin is a mini learning-project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TailwindCSS, Prisma, Ant, & Netlify. Go ahead and select a username, create notes and save them to the cloud. Access & share your notes through a link made for you!  

### For the Devs:
- First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- You should have a database up & running, save the link to the DATABASE_URL in the .env file
